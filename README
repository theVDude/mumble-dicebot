Dependencies:
* ruby_protobuf (0.4.11)

WARNING: The script will most likely not work with other implementations of protobuf, such as the "protobuf" package. Make sure you install "ruby_protobuf".



Develped for Ruby 1.9.3.


For the parameter list, run  $ mumble-dicebot -h

As of now, the script has to be aborted manually (CTRL-C). This should
automatically disconnect the bot. (Otherwise, the server will kick it
after half a minute or so of ping silence.)
