Dependcies: A protobuf implementation for Ruby,
  such as  "ruby_protobuf" (0.4.11)
  OR       "protobuf" (1.4.2)


WARNING: The script has not been tested with other protobuf
implementations. In case it fails to work with yours, run rprotoc over
Mumble.proto and replace msg.rb with the resulting file.



Developed for Ruby 1.9.3.
Made to work with Ruby 2.0.0

For the parameter list, run  $ mumble-dicebot -h

As of now, the script has to be aborted manually (CTRL-C). This should
automatically disconnect the bot. (Otherwise, the server will kick it
after half a minute or so of ping silence.)

---

I'm currently working on separating out the dice parts from the bot parts
so that I can extend the functionality beyond just dicerolls. First up is
getting it to do V20 rolls and list successes.
